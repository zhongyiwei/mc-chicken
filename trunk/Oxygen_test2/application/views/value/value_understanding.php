<p>A personal and/or cultural value is an absolute or relative ethical value, the assumption of which can be the basis for ethical action.
 A value system is a set of consistent values and measures. 
 A principle value is a foundation upon which other values and measures of integrity are based. 
 Those values which are not physiologically determined and normally considered objective, such as a desire to avoid physical pain, seek pleasure, etc., are considered subjective, vary across individuals and cultures and are in many ways aligned with belief and belief systems.
 Types of values include ethical/moral values, doctrinal/ideological (religious, political) values, social values, and aesthetic values.
 It is debated whether some values which are not clearly physiologically determined are intrinsic such as altruism and whether some such as acquisitiveness should be valued as vices or virtues.
 Values have typically been studied in sociology; anthropology; social psychology; moral philosophy and business ethics.  </p>

            <h2 class="title">Why Values?</h2>
            <div class="entry">
<p>Your values are made up of everything that has happened to you in your life and include influences from: your parents and family, your religious affiliation, your friends and peers, your education, your reading, and more. Effective people recognize these environmental influences and identify and develop a clear, concise, and meaningful set of values/beliefs, and priorities.<br/><br/>
Once defined, values impact every aspect of your life.<br/><br/>
-You demonstrate and model your values in action in your personal and work behaviors, decision making, contribution, and interpersonal interaction.<br/>
-You use your values to make decisions about priorities in your daily work and home life.<br/>
-Your goals and life purpose are grounded in your values.</p>
