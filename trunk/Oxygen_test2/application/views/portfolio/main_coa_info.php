                    A coat of arms is a distinctive heraldic design on a tunic used to cover and protect armor, but the term is more broadly applied to mean a full heraldic
                    achievement which consists of a shield and certain accessories. In either sense, the design is a symbol unique to a person, family, corporation, or state.
                    Such displays are also commonly called armorial bearings, armorial devices, heraldic devices, or arms.
                <br>
                Your personal coat of arms will be a design which can reflect your values. The 4 symbols on the shield represent each of your values.
                Your personal motto will be on the manner. Your personal Coat of Arms as a whole will be a unique symbol of you. It represents what a person you are.
