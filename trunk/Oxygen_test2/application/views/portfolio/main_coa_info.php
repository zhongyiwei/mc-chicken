                    A coat of arms is a distinctive heraldic design on a tunic used to cover and protect armor, but the term is more broadly applied to mean a full heraldic
                    achievement which consists of a shield and certain accessories. In either sense, the design is a symbol unique to a person, family, corporation, or state.
                    Such displays are also commonly called armorial bearings, armorial devices, heraldic devices, or arms.
                <br>
