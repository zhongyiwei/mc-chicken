                According to the Positive Psychology, Setting Goals is an essential part of a meaningful and happy.  On the other hand, 
                through building persistence and resilience, negative thinking and limiting belief can be reduced.
                In our daily lives, it seems that many people are setting goals, but does that mean what they do is effective?
                However, except for a lucky few, life is unlikely to be smooth sailing for many youths. 
                What then is the difference between those who achieved their goals and those who donâ€™t? We believe it is their resilience level.
        We found the theory of positive psychology which espouses that how you explain events in your life will impact your resilience level.
Hence, we conclude that any exercise in goal setting must be accompanied by resilience development for youths to achieve their goals and build a positive and happy life.

                <p>
                    Resilience is the process of adapting well in the face of adversity, trauma, tragedy, threats, or even significant sources of stress -- such as family and relationship problems, serious health problems, or workplace and financial stressors. It means "bouncing back" from difficult experiences.
                    Research has shown that resilience is ordinary, not extraordinary. 

                </p>
							<p>People commonly demonstrate resilience. One example is the response of many Americans to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and individuals' efforts to rebuild their lives.
                    Being resilient does not mean that a person doesn't experience difficulty or distress. Emotional pain and sadness are common in people who have suffered major adversity or trauma in their lives. In fact, the road to resilience is likely to involve considerable emotional distress.
                    Resilience is not a trait that people either have or do not have. It involves behaviors, thoughts, and actions that can be learned and developed in anyone.
                </p>
