<p>A personal and/or cultural value is an absolute or relative ethical value, the assumption of which can be the basis for ethical action.
 A value system is a set of consistent values and measures. 
 A principle value is a foundation upon which other values and measures of integrity are based. 
 Those values which are not physiologically determined and normally considered objective, such as a desire to avoid physical pain, seek pleasure, etc., are considered subjective, vary across individuals and cultures and are in many ways aligned with belief and belief systems.
 Types of values include ethical/moral values, doctrinal/ideological (religious, political) values, social values, and aesthetic values.
 It is debated whether some values which are not clearly physiologically determined are intrinsic such as altruism and whether some such as acquisitiveness should be valued as vices or virtues.
 Values have typically been studied in sociology; anthropology; social psychology; moral philosophy and business ethics.  </p>

<p>Your values are made up of everything that has happened to you in your life and include influences from: your parents and family, your religious affiliation, your friends and peers, your education, your reading, and more.

Once defined, values impact every aspect of your life.<br/><br/>
-You demonstrate and model your values in action in your personal and work behaviors, decision making, contribution, and interpersonal interaction.<br/>
-You use your values to make decisions about priorities in your daily work and home life.<br/>

                <p>
                    Resilience is the process of adapting well in the face of adversity, trauma, tragedy, threats, or even significant sources of stress -- such as family and relationship problems, serious health problems, or workplace and financial stressors. It means "bouncing back" from difficult experiences.
                    Research has shown that resilience is ordinary, not extraordinary. 

                </p>
							<p>People commonly demonstrate resilience. One example is the response of many Americans to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and individuals' efforts to rebuild their lives.
                    Being resilient does not mean that a person doesn't experience difficulty or distress. Emotional pain and sadness are common in people who have suffered major adversity or trauma in their lives. In fact, the road to resilience is likely to involve considerable emotional distress.
                    Resilience is not a trait that people either have or do not have. It involves behaviors, thoughts, and actions that can be learned and developed in anyone.

            <h2 class="title" id="PMS">Why emphasize on resilience?</h2>
            <div class="entry">
<p>
Resilience is an extremely important psychological trait to study because of its wide implications for mental health.
Research  findings suggest that nonresilient people are 1. associating the threat cue with a greater likelihood of the negative stimuli occurring; and 2. when the neutral stimuli occurs instead, nonresilient participants fail to appropriately match their emotional response to the content of the picture (neutral) and instead respond as if the picture was negative as expected.

                <h2>The Coat of Arms: </h2>
                <p style="font-family:arial;color:black;font-size:14px">A coat of arms is a distinctive heraldic design on a tunic used to cover and protect armor, but the term is more broadly applied to mean a full heraldic
                    achievement which consists of a shield and certain accessories. In either sense, the design is a symbol unique to a person, family, corporation, or state.
                    Such displays are also commonly called armorial bearings, armorial devices, heraldic devices, or arms.
                <br>
                Your personal coat of arms will be a design which can reflect your values and motto of your life. The 4 symbols on the shield represent each of your values.
                Your personal motto will be on the manner. Your personal Coat of Arms as a whole will be a unique symbol of you. It represents what a person you are.
