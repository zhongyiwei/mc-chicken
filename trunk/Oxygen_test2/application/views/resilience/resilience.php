            <h2 class="title">A true story of resilience --- Ms Kirsten Koh</h2>
            <div class="entry">
                <h2>Kirsten Koh's long journey back to life</h2><br><p>It is afternoon in the quiet but crowded library at Republic Polytechnic where she lectures, and Ms Kirsten Koh is weeping.
                    </p><p>We are seated at a round table in the middle of the study area. Curious students at nearby tables nervously steal glances at us. 
                    But Ms Koh does not flinch. Her shoulders are squared, 
                    her posture upright, but she makes no attempt to hide her grief. Her tears fall, but she does not make a sound.
                    </p><p>Next month, in the Sundown Marathon, the 32-year-old will attempt to walk all 42km. For a woman who once ran a marathon in 4hr 30min 
                    and completed an Olympic-distance triathlon in 2hr 50min, this does not seem a grand feat.
                    </p><p>Till you notice her body, which is a crude painting of scars. It is a body so traumatised that she could not run for a year.

                <div class="entry">
                <p>Ms Kirsten Koh and Ms Orla Gilmore were cycling along Mandai Avenue on May 19 last year when Ms Koh disappeared. 
                    Ms Gilmore recalled: 'Suddenly, this lorry came up close to my front wheel, appearing beside me. 
                    The next thing that came to my head was: Where is Kirsten? 
                    Then I saw sparks coming out from the lorry's front wheel, which was probably her bike. 
                    The lorry had dragged her underneath. I thought she was dead.'

            <h2 class="title">Her Injuries</h2>
            <div class="entry">
                <p>Ms Koh fractured both ankles and femurs. Her pelvis was shattered. Her left shoulder, fibula and shin bones were broken. 
                    The doctors told her parents to prepare for the worst. She went on to have 19 operations totalling more than 80 hours, 
                    needed 5 litres of blood transfusions and 60 stitches. She was bed-ridden for 21/2 months.'

            <div class="entry">
                <p>Since coming off her wheelchair in February, Ms Koh has embarked on a training programme seven days a week. 
                    It includes swimming, weight exercises, stationary bike cycling and four days of walking. 
                    She used to run the 9.8km distance from her home to the polytechnic where she is a lecturer. 
                    Now, she walks. She was knocked down doing her sport, now sport is helping her to get up again.
