            <div class="entry">
                <p>Goal Setting motivates a person to reach their specific goals by defining it clearly and achieving it as “our values create within us a desire to behave in a way that is consistent with our goals”</p>

                <p><strong><u>For Students:</u></strong></p>
                <p>Goals which measure academic success might include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>an increase in grade point average</li>
                    <li>improvement in note taking effectiveness</li>
                    <li>increased usage of an effective study system</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p><strong><u>For Generic:</u></strong></p>
                <p>Setting a specific goal leads to better performance compared to setting an abstract goal (e.g., “I’m going to get a 95% on my next exam” vs. “I’m going to do my best on my next exam”).</p>
                <p>We found that specific, difficult goals consistently led to higher performance than urging people to do their best. The effect sizes in meta-analyses ranged from .42 to .80 (Locke & Latham, 1990). In short, when people are asked to do their best, they do not do so. This is because do-your-best goals have no external referent and thus are defined idiosyncratically. This allows for a wide range of acceptable performance levels, which is not the case when a goal level is specified. Goal specificity in itself does not necessarily lead to high performance because specific goals vary in difficulty. However, insofar as performance is fully controllable, goal specificity does reduce variation in performance by reducing the ambiguity about what is to be attained (Locke, Chah, Harrison, & Lustgarten, 1989)</p>
                <p>That said, when people are confronted with a task that is complex for them, encouragement (e.g., urging to do their best) sometimes leads to better solving strategies than setting a specific difficult performance goal.</p>

            <div class="entry">
                <p>Yale  researchers surveyed  the  graduating class of 1953 to determine how many of them have specific, written goals  for their  future. 3%  of  them  had. Twenty  years  later, the researchers followed up with the surviving members of the class and discovered that the 3% with written goals had accumulated  more  personal wealth than the  remaining  97%  combined!</p>
