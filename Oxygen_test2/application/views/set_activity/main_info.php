            <h2 class="title" id="AC">Why set activity for your goals</h2>
            <div class="entry">
            <p>Only setting goals does not mean you will achieve them. 
                A lot of people have goals or have had goals but Most of them fail to achieve their goals because they do not 
                take specific and consistent actions to achieve these goals. In truth, the achievement of every goal in life is made up of the accomplishment
                of all activities and actions required to accomplish this goal. 
                Therefore, you have to set activities you plan to take for each
                goal you set earlier to achieve your goals. When you set activities, your activities must be very specific in terms of their name,
                details, start date and end date. This will make you more organized, planned and disciplinary in achieving each of the activities and your goals eventually.
                For each goal, there might be many actions to be taken. Set each action to be an activity for this goal. Only if you completed all the
                activities you set for this goal. you could consider you have accomplished this goal.
