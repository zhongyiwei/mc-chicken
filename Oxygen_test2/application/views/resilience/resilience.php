                    Resilience is the process of adapting well in the face of adversity, trauma, tragedy, threats, or even significant sources of stress -- such as family and relationship problems, serious health problems, or workplace and financial stressors. It means "bouncing back" from difficult experiences.
                    Research has shown that resilience is ordinary, not extraordinary. 

                </p>
							<p>People commonly demonstrate resilience. One example is the response of many Americans to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and individuals' efforts to rebuild their lives.
                    Being resilient does not mean that a person doesn't experience difficulty or distress. Emotional pain and sadness are common in people who have suffered major adversity or trauma in their lives. In fact, the road to resilience is likely to involve considerable emotional distress.
                    Resilience is not a trait that people either have or do not have. It involves behaviors, thoughts, and actions that can be learned and developed in anyone.

<p>
Resilience is an extremely important psychological trait to study because of its wide implications for mental health.
Research  findings suggest that nonresilient people are 1. associating the threat cue with a greater likelihood of the negative stimuli occurring; and 2. when the neutral stimuli occurs instead, nonresilient participants fail to appropriately match their emotional response to the content of the picture (neutral) and instead respond as if the picture was negative as expected.
